Key Functions of an API Gateway:
Request Routing: Directs incoming requests to the appropriate service based on URL, method, headers, or other rules.
Load Balancing: Distributes incoming requests to multiple instances of a service, ensuring no single instance gets overwhelmed.
Authentication & Authorization: Verifies the identity of the requester (authentication) and determines whether they have the right permissions to access a particular resource (authorization).
Rate Limiting: Restricts a client's requests in a specified time window, protecting services from potential abuse or overloads.
Request & Response Transformation: Modifies incoming requests or outgoing responses to adhere to the expected format or to add/remove specific information.
Caching: Stores frequently-used responses to minimize redundant processing and accelerate response times.
Circuit Breaking: Detects service failures and prevents the system from overloading those failing services by temporarily pausing requests.
Logging & Monitoring: Keeps track of all incoming and outgoing requests, helping in monitoring, alerting, and debugging.
Security: Provides features like SSL termination, CORS management, and protection against attacks such as SQL injection or DDoS attacks.
