Enhancing the supporting classes and data structures for Cyber AI threat modeling and triage utilities involves incorporating more sophisticated elements such as machine learning techniques for dynamic threat assessment, graph-based representations for system components interactions, and incorporating feedback loops for continuous improvement. Below, we'll creatively expand upon the initial example with these cutting-edge practices.

### Enhanced Threat Class with ML-based Dynamic Severity Assessment

We introduce machine learning models to dynamically assess the severity of threats based on changing environmental factors, historical data, and recent attack patterns.

```python
class Threat:
    def __init__(self, name, description, impact, exploitability, ml_model_path):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.impact = impact  # E.g., High, Medium, Low
        self.exploitability = exploitability  # E.g., High, Medium, Low
        self.ml_model = self.load_ml_model(ml_model_path)

    def load_ml_model(self, path):
        # Load a pre-trained ML model for dynamic severity assessment
        # This is a placeholder for actual model loading code
        return None

    def dynamic_severity_assessment(self, environmental_factors):
        # Placeholder for ML model inference logic
        # Environmental factors could include network traffic anomalies, recent similar attacks, etc.
        # Return a dynamically assessed severity level
        return "High"

    def applies_to(self, component):
        # Define logic to determine if the threat applies to the component
        pass
```

### Graph-based Representation for System Components

Utilizing graph-based structures to represent interactions between different system components can provide insights into potential attack vectors and the propagation of threats.

```python
class SystemGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = []  # List of system components
        self.edges = []  # List of tuples (source_component, target_component)

    def add_component(self, component):
        self.nodes.append(component)

    def add_interaction(self, source, target):
        self.edges.append((source, target))

    def visualize(self):
        # Placeholder for graph visualization logic
        # Could use libraries like NetworkX or Graphviz for visualization
        pass
```

### Continuous Improvement with Feedback Loops

Incorporate feedback loops from threat triage and incident response to refine threat models and improve the system's resilience to attacks.

```python
class FeedbackLoop:
    def __init__(self, triage_results):
        self.triage_results = triage_results

    def analyze_feedback(self):
        # Analyze the results of threat triage and incident response
        # Identify patterns in successfully mitigated attacks and areas for improvement
        pass

    def update_threat_library(self, threat_library):
        # Update the threat library based on feedback analysis
        # This could include adding new threats, updating threat characteristics, etc.
        pass
```

### Example Usage with Expanded Capabilities

```python
# Assuming existence of threat_library and system_graph

# Initialize system graph with components and their interactions
system_graph = SystemGraph()
system_graph.add_component(SystemComponent("Data Pipeline", "Processes training data"))
system_graph.add_component(SystemComponent("Model Server", "Serves predictions"))
system_graph.add_interaction("Data Pipeline", "Model Server")

# Dynamic threat assessment based on current environmental factors
environmental_factors = {"network_traffic_anomaly": True}
for threat in threat_library:
    dynamic_severity = threat.dynamic_severity_assessment(environmental_factors)
    print(f"Dynamic Severity for {threat.name}: {dynamic_severity}")

# After triage, analyze feedback and update threat library
feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop(triage_results)
feedback_loop.analyze_feedback()
feedback_loop.update_threat_library(threat_library)
```

### Conclusion

By integrating machine learning for dynamic threat assessment, utilizing graph-based representations of system components, and incorporating feedback loops for continuous refinement, this expanded utility framework for Cyber AI threat modeling and triage becomes significantly more robust and adaptive. This approach leverages cutting-edge practices to provide a comprehensive, evolving defense mechanism against adversarial AI threats.
